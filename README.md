# Bi-Directional-DC-DC-converter-with-ZVT-for-Electric-Vehicles
Learning Outcomes:
Our main intent is that we could make a simple bi-directional DC-DC converter with lower conduction losses and higher efficiency.
This converter should be functional in high voltage applications so that it can be applied in hybrid energy storage systems used in electric vehicles.
